## Overview!

Mystical Adventure is a text-based adventure game I made with the pygame framework as a way to solidify my foundation as I complete my Python to AI journey. The game includes graphical elements created by an AI called Midjourney, that immerse players in a Qi cultivator's life. In this game you will navigate through enchanting landscapes, face formidable adversaries, and make choices that will shape your destiny.

### Ideas for the future:
- [ ] Add background music to each scene

## Getting Started

### Version of Python used
python 3.10

### Installation

Step 1: Download the Game Files

    On this repository page, find a green button labeled Code towards the top right. Click on it.
    A dropdown menu will appear. Click on the Download ZIP option from the dropdown.
    Once clicked, a ZIP file of the game will start downloading. Once downloaded, locate the ZIP file (usually in your Downloads folder) and extract it. 
    On most computers, you can do this by right-clicking on the file and selecting 'Extract All'.

Step 2: Navigate to the Game Directory

    After extracting the ZIP file, you will get a folder named Mystical-Adventure-main.
    Open this folder.

Step 3: Run the Game

    Inside the Mystical-Adventure-main folder, find a file named MA_main.py. This is the game file.
    Double click on the MA_main.py file. The game should start!

Note: If the game doesn't start upon double-clicking, it might be because your computer doesn't know how to run Python files by default. In this case:

    Right-click the MA_main.py file.
    Choose 'Open with'.
    From the list of programs, select Python, and the game should start. If Python isn't listed, it means Python might not be installed on your computer. You'd need to install it from the official Python website.

Enjoy the Game!

Now you're all set to dive into the mystical world of Qi cultivation. Enjoy your journey in "Mystical Adventure" and make choices that will shape your destiny!
