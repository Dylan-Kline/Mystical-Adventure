## Overview!

Mystical Adventure is a text-based adventure game I made with the pygame framework as a way to solidify my foundation as I complete my Python to AI journey. The game includes graphical elements created by an AI called Midjourney, that immerse players in a Qi cultivator's life. In this game you will navigate through enchanting landscapes, face formidable adversaries, and make choices that will shape your destiny.

### Ideas for the future:
- [ ] Add background music to each scene
